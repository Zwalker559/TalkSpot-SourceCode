1.  Go to the **Firebase Console** for your project.
2.  Navigate to the **Authentication** section.
3.  Click on the **Templates** tab.
4.  Select **Password reset** from the list of email templates.
5.  **Enable** the template and customize it if you wish.

Once enabled, the application will be able to send password reset emails to your users.
